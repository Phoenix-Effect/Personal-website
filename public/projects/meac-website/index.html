<p>MEAC is a lab at ASU which does biomarker analysis on given samples. People from other universities can also send in their samples and get them tested.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>A website where users can</p>

<ul>
<li>Get information about lab equipment and the types of tests the lab does.</li>
<li>View pricing of the lab and get a quick estimate of price base on their type of testing and number of samples.</li>
<li>Place online order, view order status and get results online.</li>
<li>Receive email updates on order status change.</li>
<li>A control panel where they can view all past orders, their status and invoices.</li>
</ul>

<p>and administrator can</p>

<ul>
<li>View status of all current and past orders.</li>
<li>Change status of any order while automatically informing the customer.</li>
<li>Generate invoice with the ability to apply custom discounts and coupons.</li>
<li>A ledger to view reports of monthly or annual sales and profits.</li>
</ul>

<p>and</p>

<ul>
<li>The website needs to follow ASU brand guidelines.</li>
<li>Be accessible.</li>
<li>Hosted on ASU approved platform.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<h3 id="toolbox">Toolbox</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wordpress:</strong> For quickly creating content pages along with <strong>Gravity Forms</strong> plugin to make a price calculator and ordering forms.</li>
<li><strong>WooCommerce:</strong> For keeping track of all orders and making user control panel.</li>
<li><strong>Sendgrid:</strong> For sending out all transactional emails and getting delivery reports.</li>
<li><strong>Dompdf:</strong> PHP library used to convert HTML invoices to PDF.</li>
<li><strong>Pantheon:</strong> Hosting platform that comes with version control and feature branching used to deploy and host the website.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>The project took about a month, most of which was spent on research and testing. I wrote about 600 lines of code to implement the functional requirements and around 400 for non-functional requirements like styling the content. Since in a typical ecommerce website an order is shipped out by the store I had to modify the workflow of orders and add new order statuses as appropriate. Since the lab only accepts payment in checks I did not have to add any online payment gateway. I spent most of the time making sure the order workflow made sense for both the administrator and the customer and that transactional emails went out when they were supposed to.</p>
